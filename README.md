# Threes

The game "Threes" made in Python.

# Course of the project ?

This project was completed in my first academic year. It was a directed project which had for goal to make us discover the course and the management of a python project. Indeed, we had a plan that described to us the organization of python modules and the signing of the functions (not all) and we had to carry out their implementation. Some freedoms were also taken to better organize the code.

# How to use ?

To use this project, you must download the package threes_game.
